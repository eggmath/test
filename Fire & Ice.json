  "description": "Things could not possibly be worse for Fire and Ice, in Beatriz da Costa's professional opinion. Superman sent the former Justice Leaguers packing for Smallville following an extremely public and utterly disastrous mission (that was all Guy Gardner's fault, thank you very much) and in doing so doomed them to a fate worse than death: irrelevance.\n\nIce finds herself drawn to the quiet life and dreams of planting roots. But Fire...well, Fire will do just about anything to get the heck outta Dodge and back on the hero circuit--including challenging the DCU's biggest villains to a knock-down, drag-out, live-streamed brawl in the streets of Smallville!\n\nA raucous, timely, unflinching comedy about a decades-long friendship on the brink of disaster and what it means to be a superhero at a crossroads in your life, Fire & Ice: Welcome to Smallville reintroduces the iconic duo to the Dawn of DC, in a series from rising star Joanne Starer (The Gimmick, Sirens of the City) and Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur co-creator Natacha Bustos!",
